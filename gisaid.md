Sequencing sites can opt-in to a process where consensus sequences uploaded to CLIMB are automatically submitted to GISAID on their behalf.
You can opt-in via your [Institute profile on Majora](https://majora.covid19.climb.ac.uk/forms/institute/).
One only user per site needs to provide this information and it is does not need to be the same person who provides the metadata or uploads the sequences.

## How do I opt-in?

You will need to provide:

* your COG-UK barcode prefix as assigned by WSI, or your own prefix that you will use consistently
* your e-mail address (we will pass this on to GISAID curators to contact you about your entries)
* a valid GISAID username (**if you have not registered, [you will need to get a GISAID account first](https://www.gisaid.org/registration/register/)**) 
* the name of the lab or labs that you wish to credit as the originating lab (this will include your sequencing lab)
* a list of people you wish you credit

## What will I have to do?

Bulk uploads are generated first thing Monday, based on the data freeze from the previous Friday afternoon.
Metadata is automatically gathered from Majora and automatically inserted into a Google Sheet for sites to quickly confirm their sequences. Once signed off by all sites, the bulk upload is sent directly to GISAID.
