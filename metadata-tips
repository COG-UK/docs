## You have an account?

* [You registered for a unified CLIMB account](https://majora.covid19.climb.ac.uk/forms/register) and you've had an e-mail to tell you it was approved?
* [You have an API key token on your CLIMB profile](https://majora.covid19.climb.ac.uk/accounts/profile/)?

## You have read the docs?

* You know what a biosample, library and sequencing run is and what identifier they should have (ie. you read [Terminology and minimal metadata](/metadata))
* If you're submitting via the web tool, [you have read those docs](https://docs.cog-uk.io/metadata/)?

## You have uploaded data to us at least once before?

* You have [registered for a test account](https://covid.majora.ironowl.it/forms/register)?
* This test account is different from your real CLIMB account and begins with `test-`?
* You have your [API key token from your test profile](https://covid.majora.ironowl.it/accounts/profile/)?
* You have tried one of the two ways to upload metadata and checked it looked right on the website?

## (a) You have tested using the web tool before?

* You have [tested an upload of a CSV or XLSX to us before](https://metadata.cog-uk.io/)?
* You used your test username and test API key?

## (b) You have tested the `ocarina` API before?

* You have [downloaded ocarina](https://github.com/SamStudio8/ocarina)
* You have set the `MAJORA_DOMAIN` to `https://covid.majora.ironowl.it/` for testing?
* You set the `MAJORA_USER` and `MAJORA_TOKEN` to your testing username and token?
* You have tried:
    * `ocarina put biosample`?
    * `ocarina put library`?
    * `ocarina put sequencing`?
    
## Your data is ready?

* You have provided at least the [minimum metadata](/metadata)?
* Your samples have one and only one, single, unique, shareable identifier?
* Your pooled sample libraries have a name that is reasonably unique? (`BIRM-LIBRARY-001` good, `1` bad).
* Your sequencing runs have a name that is reasonably unique? (`<date>_<machine_id>_<run_no>_<some_zeros>_<flowcell>` good, `my-run` bad)
* You are aware that once a record has been submitted, its `central_sample_id` (COGUK ID), `library_name` and `run_name` cannot be changed.
* For spreadsheet-like uploads, your data is in a CSV or XLSX with the right template for the webtool?
