# Using investigation fields to label specific sample types

The `investigation_name`, `investigation_cluster`, and `investigation_site` are optional, consortium visible fields within the COG-UK dataset. To aid analysis, the consortium is defining standardised approaches to using these fields for some sample types.

## Samples from universities
Please label samples from universities by adding “UNIVERSITY” to the `investigation_name` metadata field.
Individual sites can set their own `investigation_site` and even `investigation_cluster` for fine scale grouping (staff/students, campus etc). **N.B. These fields are visible to the consortium so ensure that you have permision to share the data and that nothing potentially identifying is included.**
